    text: `In 2018 I moved 200 miles away from my partner for work after we graduated from college. I would drive to see him every other weekend. He has not had stable employment at all in the four years since we graduated. He did not drive to see me once in the four years I lived in my apartment.

    At the start of the pandemic, I drove to his apartment. I didn’t know when we were going to be called back to the office, so I kept my apartment thinking things might calm down in a few weeks. I ended up staying with him for a few months leaving only because I needed to check on my apartment.
    
    Thanks everyone!`,

    He was just seeing what he could get away with and when he realized you were going to push back, he backed down and pretended like he didn't mean it.
    
    TBF, he sounds like a fucking asshole. What do you even see in him? It's not healthy to be fighting in relationships all the time like that. You can do much better, I promise.`,

    It sounds like he doesnt want to work so hes going to use you as a way to pay for that now that a job has been offered to him.`,

He sounds like an entitled child versus a functional adult. Break it off now and do not entertain any crap he gives you about what you owe him. You owe him nothing.`,

    text: `You're putting far more effort into this relationship than he is. You're the one with a steady job and he's living outside his means and expects you to foot the bill on everything. He may be apologizing now because he realized he's poked the bear too hard demanding that much money, but I suspect he very much will still see you as a meal ticket helping to pay his bills going forward. Make it clear to him that you will not be giving him any money and will not be moving in with him for the foreseeable future, and he can make more effort to visit you if he wants to see you. His reaction should tell you all you need to know, but after (over?) 4 years it sounds like this is who he is and what you can expect from him.`,

    text: `No, no, no. Do not pay him anything.

    If there is no firm agreement in place beforehand - preferably in writing - nothing is owed and you need to stick to this.
    
    If you pay him, who knows what else he will later try to charge you for after the fact. I believe if this becomes a pattern there are legal implications as well, he would have reasonable expectation that you would pay him for whatever he demands.
    
    Honestly it sounds like he’s using you and/or halfway out the door. He could be trying to make sure you pay up before he dumps you.`,
